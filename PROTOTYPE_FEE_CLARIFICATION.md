## 🎤 HOW TO PRESENT THIS

### Opening Statement:

**"The prototype you're seeing today requires a $2,500 fee. This gives you a working system to test, see how it works, and validate everything before committing to full production."**

**"If you pay the prototype fee and decide to proceed with production, that $2,500 is credited toward the production cost - so you're not paying twice."**

**"It's essentially a deposit that gets applied to production if you move forward."**
