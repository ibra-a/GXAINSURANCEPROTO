# Which Contract Should I Bring?

## ✅ RECOMMENDATION: Bring TWO Contracts

---

## Contract 1: Web App Production (Primary)

**File:** `CONTRACT_PHASE2_PRODUCTION.md` or the PDF version

**Why:** This is your main contract - for the web application that admin staff need. GXA doesn't have a web app for admins yet, so this is essential.

**Shows:**
- Web application: $12,500 (net $10,000 after prototype credit)
- Total: $15,000 investment
- 3-4 month timeline

---

## Contract 2: Mobile App Option (Secondary)

**File:** `CONTRACT_MOBILE_WEB_COMBINED.md` (I just created this)

**Why:** They originally wanted mobile apps. This shows mobile app pricing and the combined option.

**Shows:**
- Mobile apps (iOS + Android): $8,000-10,000
- Combined package (web + mobile): $18,450 (save $4,550)
- Or mobile add-on: $8,000 (if ordered within 90 days)

## 🎯 Presentation Strategy

### Step 1: Present Web App (Primary Focus)

**"You currently don't have a web application for your admin staff. This web app solves that problem:"**

- Admin dashboard for staff to use on **computers** (for paperwork, document review, printing)
- Customer portal for claims (works on phones AND computers)
- **Staff can work efficiently on desktop computers** - reviewing claims, handling paperwork, printing documents
- **Customers can use phones** - submit claims on-the-go
- One system, works everywhere
- **This is what your staff need right now**

**"For the web application: $15,000 total investment ($2,500 prototype credited, net payment $10,000)"**

### Step 2: Present Mobile App (Secondary Option)

**"You mentioned wanting mobile apps. The web app works great on phones, but if you want native iOS and Android apps in the App Store:"**

**Options:**
- Add mobile apps later: $8,000-10,000
- Bundle now: $18,450 for everything (save $4,550)

**"My recommendation: Start with the web app. Your staff need it now. We can add native mobile apps later, and you'll still get the early adopter discount if ordered within 90 days."**

## 💬 Script for Mobile App Discussion

### When They Ask About Mobile App:

**"The web application I'm proposing works on both computers and mobile phones:"**

**"For your staff:** They use computers in the office - perfect for paperwork, document review, printing, detailed analysis. The web app gives them full functionality on desktop.

**"For your customers:** They can use phones to submit claims - no computer needed.

**"I know you originally mentioned mobile apps, and this web app works on phones. But if you want native iOS and Android apps in the App Store, we can add those."**

**"Here are your options:"**

**Option 1: Start with Web App**
- "Web app works perfectly on phones"
- "Your staff need the admin dashboard now"
- "Total: $15,000"
- "Add mobile apps later if needed: $8,000-10,000"

**Option 2: Bundle Everything**
- "Web app + native mobile apps"
- "Total: $18,450 (save $4,550)"
- "Everything delivered together"

**"My recommendation: Start with web app. You need the admin system now. Mobile apps can come later - you'll still save money with the early adopter discount."**
