### Phase 2: Present Mobile App Option
- "You mentioned wanting a mobile app. We can build native iOS and Android apps"
- "This would be an additional $8,000 (early adopter price) or $10,000 regular"
- "Or we can do both together: $18,450 instead of $23,000 (save $4,550)"

### Value Proposition:
- **Web App:** Works everywhere, no app store approval needed, easier updates
- **Mobile App:** Better user experience, push notifications, works offline, feels native
- **Both:** Maximum reach - web for flexibility, apps for premium experience

## TALKING POINTS

**When presenting mobile app option:**

1. **"The web app works great on phones through the browser"**
   - But native apps offer better experience

2. **"We can build native iOS and Android apps for $8,000-10,000"**
   - Includes both platforms
   - Includes App Store setup
   - Includes push notifications

3. **"Or we can bundle: web + mobile together for $18,450"**
   - Save $4,550 vs buying separately
   - Everything delivered together
   - One unified system

4. **"Recommendation: Start with web app, add mobile later"**
   - Web app launches faster (3-4 months)
   - Can add mobile app after (another 3-4 months)
   - Still get early adopter discount if ordered within 90 days

**Good luck with the presentation!** 💪
