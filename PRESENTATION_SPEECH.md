# GXA Presentation Speech Guide
**How to Present Your Price - Step by Step**

---

## 🎯 Opening (2 minutes)

### Script:

**"Good [morning/afternoon]. Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today."**

**"My name is Ibrahim Abdourahman, and I'm the owner of Gaboodai Solutions. We're a Djibouti-based software development company specializing in digital transformation for local businesses."**

**"Today, I'm excited to present what we've built for GXA - a complete digital insurance claims platform. This system transforms how your customers submit claims - from paper forms to a modern, mobile-first solution that works right on their phones."**

**"I'm going to show you the working prototype, explain the value it provides, and then we'll discuss pricing and next steps."**

---

## 📱 Part 1: Demo the System (8-10 minutes)

### Transition:

**"Let me start by showing you what we've built..."**

### Demo Flow:

1. **Landing Page**
   - "Here's the professional GXA homepage - your branding, your colors"
   - "Customers can access this from anywhere"

2. **Customer Experience**
   - "Customers click 'New Claim' and start the process"
   - **KEY POINT:** "This is all mobile-first - designed for phones because that's where your customers are"
   - **IMPORTANT:** "But it also works perfectly on computers - customers can use either"

3. **Photo Capture (THE BIG MOMENT)**
   - "Here's the key feature - photo capture"
   - **Emphasize:** "Photos are taken directly from the phone - no file uploads. Just like WhatsApp - take photo, preview, use it or retake."
   - **CRITICAL:** "And here's the fraud prevention: Every photo is automatically tagged with GPS location and timestamp. You can't fake where or when a photo was taken. This prevents fraudulent claims."
   - **Value:** "This saves you 20-30% on fraudulent claims alone."

4. **Submit Claim**
   - "Simple 5-step process, takes 5 minutes"
   - "Customer gets instant claim number"

5. **Admin Dashboard**
   - "Now let's see your side - the admin dashboard"
   - **CRITICAL POINT:** "This web app is essential for your admin staff. They need to use computers for paperwork, document review, printing, and detailed analysis. This system gives them that - full functionality on desktop computers in the office."
   - "All claims appear instantly - you see everything in one place"
   - "Click any claim to review, see all photos in gallery"
   - "Approve or reject with one click - customer gets instant notification"
   - **Emphasize:** "Your staff can work efficiently on their computers - reviewing claims, printing documents, handling paperwork - while customers can submit claims from their phones. Best of both worlds."
   - **Value:** "This is 70% faster than paper forms. One staff member can process 3x more claims per day."

---

## 💰 Part 2: Presenting the Value First (3 minutes)

### Transition:

**"You're probably wondering what this costs. Before I tell you the price, let me show you what this system saves you..."**

### Value Proposition Script:

**"This system provides significant value to GXA:"**

1. **Time Savings:**
   - "Claims processed 70% faster - from days to hours"
   - "Staff processes 3x more claims per day"
   - **"That's like hiring 2 extra staff members - for free."**

2. **Cost Savings:**
   - "60% fewer customer support calls - customers help themselves"
   - "Less admin work - automated data entry"
   - **"Estimated savings: $6,000-9,600 per year in labor costs"**

3. **Fraud Prevention:**
   - "GPS verification prevents fake claims"
   - "Can't fake location or timestamp"
   - **"Saves $24,000-60,000 per year in fraudulent claims"**

4. **Competitive Advantage:**
   - "Most advanced insurance system in Djibouti"
   - "24/7 availability - customers can claim anytime"
   - "Professional, modern image"

### Total Value Statement:

**"Total annual value: $35,000 to $80,000 per year in savings and prevented losses."**

**Pause for effect...**

**"The system pays for itself in 2-3 months. After that, it's pure profit and competitive advantage."**

---

## 💵 Part 3: Presenting the Price (2 minutes)

### Transition:

**"Now, let's talk about investment..."**

### Pricing Script - The Professional Way:

**"We've structured this as a two-phase approach:"**

#### Phase 1: Prototype ($2,500)
**"First, we built a working prototype so you can test everything. This prototype fee is $2,500. This allows you to:**
- See the system in action
- Test all features
- Verify it works for GXA
- Make an informed decision"

**"The prototype fee is fully credited toward production if you proceed."**

#### Phase 2: Production ($12,500)
**"For full production - which includes everything you've seen plus:**
- API integrations with your existing systems
- Payment gateway setup
- Production deployment
- Staff training
- 90-day warranty
- Complete documentation"

**"The production fee is $12,500."**

### Total Investment Statement:

**"So your total investment is $15,000:**
- Prototype: $2,500 (this is credited toward production)
- Production: $12,500
- **Net payment due: $10,000** (after prototype credit)"

**Show confidence here - pause and let it sink in.**

---

## 📊 Part 4: ROI Justification (1 minute)

### Script:

**"Let me show you the math:"**

**"Total investment: $15,000"**

**"Annual savings: $35,000 to $80,000"**

**"That means this system pays for itself in 2-3 months. After that, every dollar saved is pure benefit to GXA."**

**"For comparison, similar international solutions cost $20,000 to $50,000. We're offering local support, customization, and a relationship that international companies can't provide - at a fraction of the cost."**

**"Plus, you own the system. It's yours. No monthly licensing fees for the software itself."**

---

## 💳 Part 5: Payment Terms (1 minute)

### Script:

**"Payment is structured to work with your cash flow:"**

**"We require:**
- **40% ($4,000) at contract signing** - This gets us started
- **30% ($3,000) after core development** - You see the system taking shape
- **20% ($2,000) after integration testing** - Everything connected
- **10% ($1,000) at production launch** - Final payment when you're happy

**"These payments are based on the net amount of $10,000 after the prototype credit."**

**"This spreads the investment over 3-4 months as we build the system."**

**"Or, if you prefer, we can discuss a payment plan - monthly installments over 6 or 12 months."**

---

## 📱 Part 6: Mobile App Option (If They Ask) (2 minutes)

### If They Mention Mobile App:

**"Great question. Let me clarify the flexibility:"**

**"The web application works on BOTH:"**
- **"Computers - Perfect for your admin staff doing paperwork, document review, printing"**
- **"Mobile phones - Customers can submit claims from their phones"**
- **"No separate app needed - one system works everywhere"**

**"This is exactly what you need: Staff use computers in the office for their work, customers use phones on-the-go. Same system, different devices."**

**"If you want native iOS and Android apps in the App Store, we can build those too. But the web app already covers both use cases."**

**"For native mobile apps, it's an additional $8,000 if you order within 90 days of web launch (early adopter price), or $10,000 regular price."**

**"Or, if you want both web and mobile together, we can bundle it: $18,450 total instead of $23,000 - you save $4,550."**

**"My recommendation: Start with the web app. It works great on phones. You can always add native apps later, and you'll still get the early adopter discount if you order within 90 days."**

## 🏢 Part 7: CRM System (If They Ask) (2 minutes)

### If They Request Full CRM:

**"The admin dashboard handles claims management. If you want a full CRM system for managing customers, policies, communications, and advanced analytics, we can add that."**

**"Here are your options:"**

**Option 1: Enhanced Admin Dashboard with CRM ($10,000)**
- Customer database and profiles
- Policy management
- Communication logs
- Basic analytics dashboard
- Task management
- Integrates with claims system
- Timeline: 3-4 months

**Option 2: Full Enterprise CRM ($20,000)**
- Everything in Option 1, plus:
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Automated workflows
- Email/SMS integration
- Calendar and task management
- Team collaboration
- Custom integrations
- Timeline: 5-6 months

**"My recommendation: Start with Enhanced Admin Dashboard. You get essential CRM features integrated with your claims system. We can add advanced features later."**

**"Benefits:**
- One unified system (not separate platforms)
- Lower upfront cost
- Ability to expand as needed
- All data in one place"

**"For comparison, standalone CRM systems cost $50,000-100,000. At $10,000-20,000, you get local support, customization, and integration with your existing claims system."**

---

## 🛠️ Part 8: Ongoing Support (1 minute)

### Script:

**"After launch, we offer optional maintenance packages:"**

**"Standard Support: $200 per month**
- Email support, bug fixes, hosting management, security updates"

**"Priority Support: $300 per month**
- Everything in Standard, plus 24-hour response, phone support, proactive monitoring"

**"Or you can handle hosting yourself - we'll show you how. Maintenance is completely optional."**

---

## ❓ Part 9: Handling Questions (Be Ready)

---

- Phase 1: Basic claim submission (reduce to $10,000)
- Phase 2: Add advanced features later (API integrations, etc.)
- This spreads the investment

**Or we can discuss a subscription model - lower upfront, monthly payments."**

---

**Response:**
**"Training is included:**
- 2 sessions, 2 hours each
- We train your admin staff on the dashboard
- Documentation provided
- Video recordings available

- Additional training: $200 per session
- Extended support: Optional monthly packages"

---

#### Q: "When can we launch?"

**Response:**
**"Production development takes 3-4 months from contract signing:**
- Weeks 1-4: Discovery and API setup
- Weeks 5-12: Core development
- Weeks 13-16: Integration and testing
