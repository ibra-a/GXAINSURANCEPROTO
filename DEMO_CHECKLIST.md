### If Claim Doesn't Submit
- Check console for errors
- **SAY:** "Let me check... sometimes network issues. But in production with stable connection, this works perfectly."
- Try again or use existing test claim

### If Photo Doesn't Load
- **SAY:** "May be a caching issue. In production, photos load instantly."
- Continue with demo using other photos

### If Something Breaks
- Stay calm
- **SAY:** "This is why we test - to catch any issues. Production deployment is more stable."
