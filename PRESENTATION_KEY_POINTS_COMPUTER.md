## 💬 EXACT WORDS TO USE

### When Presenting Admin Dashboard:

**"Here's the admin dashboard - and this is why the web app is essential for your staff:"**

**"Your admin team needs to work on computers because they:**
- Review detailed claim information
- Handle paperwork and documents
- Print reports and forms
- Need large screens for detailed analysis
- Use keyboard for typing reports and notes
- Multi-task with other applications"

**"The web app gives them full functionality on desktop computers. They can work efficiently in the office, just like they do now, but 70% faster."**

### When Presenting Customer Portal:

**"For customers, it works on phones - they can submit claims anywhere. But if they prefer, they can also use a computer at home."**

**"One system, works everywhere - computer for office work, phone for on-the-go."**

### When Discussing Mobile Apps:

**"I understand you mentioned mobile apps. The web app already works on phones AND computers. Your staff can use computers for their paperwork, customers can use phones for convenience."**

**"If you want native iOS/Android apps in the App Store, we can add those. But the web app already covers both needs - staff on computers, customers on phones."**
