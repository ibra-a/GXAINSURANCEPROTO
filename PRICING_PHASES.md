## 💼 Presentation Strategy

### When Presenting Prototype:

**"We've built a working prototype to demonstrate the full functionality. This prototype fee of $2,500 covers the development time and allows you to test everything before committing to full production."**

**"When you approve moving forward, this $2,500 is credited toward the full production contract, making your total investment $15,000, with only $10,000 net payment remaining for production."**

**"The full production system will include everything you see in the prototype, plus production deployment, training, and full support."**

## 🎁 Negotiation Tips

### If They Want Lower Prototype Fee:

**Response:** "The prototype fee is credited toward production. So if you proceed, you're only paying $12,500 total - the prototype is essentially free. If you don't proceed, the $2,500 covers the development time."

**Alternative:** "I can reduce prototype fee to $2,000 if you commit to full production within 30 days."

### If They Want Prototype Free:

**Response:** "I understand, but the prototype represents significant development work. However, if you sign the full production contract today, I'll waive the prototype fee entirely - total would be $12,500 instead of $15,000."

### If They Question Total Price:

**Response:** "This system saves you $35,000-80,000 per year. At $15,000 total, it pays for itself in 2-3 months. After that, it's pure savings and competitive advantage."

---

## 📝 Updated Contract Language

### In Prototype Contract:

**"Prototype Fee Credit:**
The prototype fee of $2,500 paid under this Agreement shall be credited toward the Full Production Agreement. If Client proceeds with Full Production within 90 days of prototype delivery, the prototype fee will be deducted from the production fee, resulting in a net production payment of $10,000 (total investment $12,500)."

---

## 🚀 Alternative: Higher Total Price

If you want to charge more:

### Option A: $18,000 Total
- Prototype: $3,000
- Production: $15,000
- After credit: $15,000 for production

### Option B: $20,000 Total
- Prototype: $3,000
- Production: $17,000
- After credit: $17,000 for production

**Rationale:** Still excellent ROI for client, more compensation for you.

---

## 💡 Final Recommendation

### **Go with $15,000 Total**

**Breakdown:**
- Prototype: **$2,500** (now)
- Production: **$12,500** (after approval)
- Total: **$15,000**
- Net after credit: **$12,500** (if prototype paid)

**Why This Works:**
✅ Fair compensation  
✅ Good value for client  
✅ Prototype shows commitment  
✅ Total is reasonable  
✅ Prototype fee credited (nice gesture)  

**Payment Flow:**
1. Present prototype → Get $2,500
2. Get approval → Sign production contract
3. Production payment: $12,500 - $2,500 credit = $10,000
4. Or: $5,000 at start, $5,000 at completion

---

## 📋 Quick Reference

**Prototype Phase:**
- Price: $2,500
- Due: Now (at presentation)
- Credited: Yes (if production approved)

**Production Phase:**
- Price: $12,500
- Credit: -$2,500
- Net: $10,000
- Split: $5k start, $5k completion

**Total Investment:** $15,000

**ROI for Client:** 2-3 months (saves $35k-80k/year)

---

**This structure works perfectly! Prototype proves value, then full production delivers complete solution. $15k total is fair for both parties.** 💪
