**Streamlined - Ready to Practice**

---

## 🎬 OPENING (30 seconds)

**"Thank you for meeting with me today."**

**"I've built a working prototype of a digital insurance claims system specifically for GXA. Today I'll show you what it does, how it saves you money and time, and what the next steps would be."**

**"Shall I start with a live demonstration?"**

**[Wait for yes, then open laptop]**

## 📱 DEMO (4 minutes)

### Part 1: Landing Page (30 sec)
**[Show landing page]**

**"This is the customer entry point. Professional, branded for GXA, mobile-friendly."**

### Part 2: Customer Claim Submission (1.5 min)
**[Navigate to User Dashboard]**

**"Customers log in here. They can submit new claims with just a few taps."**

**[Click "New Claim"]**

**"They select claim type - vehicle, property, medical, etc."**

**[Show vehicle claim flow]**

**"For vehicle claims, they enter incident details, upload photos directly from their phone camera, and submit."**

**"The photos include GPS verification to prevent fraud."**

**[Show photo capture]**

**"This works perfectly on mobile phones - that's where most claims happen."**

### Part 3: Admin Dashboard (1.5 min)
**[Switch to Admin Dashboard]**

**"Your staff see this admin dashboard."**

**[Show pending claims]**

**"Click any claim to see full details - customer info, photos, timeline."**

### Part 4: Photo System Highlight (30 sec)

## 💰 VALUE & PRICING (2 minutes)

### Transition:
**"So what does this cost and what value does it deliver?"**

### Value First:
**"This system saves GXA $35,000 to $80,000 per year."**

**"How?"**
- **Labor savings:** $6,000-9,600/year (faster processing, fewer calls)
- **Fraud prevention:** $24,000-60,000/year (GPS verification, photo verification)
- **Operational:** $5,000-10,000/year (24/7 availability, better customer experience)

**"That means this system pays for itself in 2-3 months. After that, every dollar saved is pure benefit."**

### Pricing:
**"The total investment is $15,000. Here's the breakdown:"**

- **Prototype:** $2,500 - "You've already paid this, and it's credited toward production"
- **Production:** $12,500 - "Full production system with API integrations, payment gateway, everything"
- **Net payment:** $10,000 - "After prototype credit"

**"Payment is structured to work with your cash flow:"**
- **40% ($4,000)** at contract signing
- **30% ($3,000)** after core development
- **20% ($2,000)** after integration testing
- **10% ($1,000)** at production launch

**"This spreads the investment over 3-4 months as we build."**

### Comparison:
**"For comparison, similar international solutions cost $20,000 to $50,000. We're offering local support, customization, and a relationship that international companies can't provide - at a fraction of the cost."**

**"Plus, you own the system. It's yours. No monthly licensing fees for the software itself."**

---

## 🖥️ COMPUTER vs MOBILE (30 seconds - if needed)

**"Important point: This works on both computers and phones."**

**"For your staff doing paperwork, reports, detailed reviews - they'll use computers. Much easier than trying to do that on a phone."**

**"For customers submitting claims from an accident scene - they use their phones. Perfect for mobile."**

**"One system, works everywhere."**

---

## 📱 MOBILE APP (if they ask)

**"The web app works great on phones via browser. If you want native iOS and Android apps later, that's an additional $8,000 if ordered within 90 days, or $10,000 regular price."**

**"Or we can bundle: web + mobile together for $18,450 total instead of $23,000 - you save $4,550."**

**"My recommendation: Start with the web app. It works perfectly on phones. Add native apps later if needed."**

---

## 🏢 CRM (if they ask)

**"The admin dashboard handles claims. If you want a full CRM system for customer management, policy management, communications, analytics - we can add that for $10,000-20,000 depending on features."**

**"My recommendation: Start with the claims system. Add CRM features later if needed."**

---

## 🛠️ SUPPORT (30 seconds)

**"After launch, we offer optional maintenance packages:"**

- **Standard:** $200/month - "Email support, bug fixes, updates"
- **Priority:** $300/month - "24-hour response, phone support, priority fixes"

**"Or you can handle hosting yourself - we'll show you how. Maintenance is completely optional."**

**"Plus, you get 90-day warranty included - any bugs or issues, we fix them free."**

---

## 📅 TIMELINE (30 seconds)

**"Timeline: 3-4 months for full production."**

**"Weeks 1-4: Discovery and API setup"**
**"Weeks 5-12: Core development"**
**"Weeks 13-16: Integration and testing"**
**"Weeks 17-18: Launch and training"**

**"I'll train your staff - up to 4 sessions, 2 hours each."**

## ❓ HANDLING QUESTIONS

### "That seems expensive"
**"I understand. But consider: This saves you $35,000-80,000 per year. At $15,000, it pays for itself in 2-3 months. After that, it's pure savings. What budget works for you?"**

### "Can you do it cheaper?"
**"I can adjust the scope. For example, we could start with basic features for $10,000, then add advanced features later. What's most important to you?"**

### "How long will it take?"
**"3-4 months for full production. I can start immediately after contract signing."**

### "What if it doesn't work?"
**"90-day warranty - any bugs, I fix them. Plus, you're seeing a working prototype right now. The production version will be even better."**

### "We need to think about it"
**"Absolutely. Take your time. I'll send you a written proposal by tomorrow with all details. Happy to answer any questions."**
