**Solution:**
- "This is demo environment. Production is faster with optimized servers."
- Continue with demo
- Don't make a big deal of it

### Scenario 3: Something Breaks
**Solution:**
- Stay calm
- "This is why we test - to catch issues before production."
- Skip to admin dashboard (should always work)
- Or use existing test claims

### Scenario 4: Owner Asks Hard Question
**Solution:**
- Don't make up answers
- "Great question. Let me check that detail."
- Use FAQ.md
- Or: "I'll get you that information after the meeting."

### Scenario 5: Owner Seems Uninterested
**Solution:**
- Focus on business value (money saved)
