## 🎯 HANDLING HIS MOBILE APP INSISTENCE

### If He Says: "I definitely want mobile apps"
**Response:**
**"Perfect! Then the bundle makes the most sense. You get both web and mobile for $15,950 net - saves you $4,550 and gives you one integrated system. The web app launches first (3-4 months), then mobile apps 4-6 weeks later."**

### If He Says: "Let's start with web, mobile later"
**Response:**
**"Absolutely, that works. The web app works great on phones, so you're covered there. When you're ready for native apps, it's $8,000 if ordered within 90 days, or $10,000 regular price. I'll note that in the proposal."**

### If He Says: "Why not just mobile apps?"
**Response:**
**"Great question. Here's why web makes sense: Your staff need computers for detailed work - reviewing claims, printing documents, generating reports. Mobile is perfect for customers submitting claims from accident scenes. You need both:**
- **Web for staff** - full functionality on computers
- **Mobile for customers** - convenient claim submission
- **Both work together** - same data, same system"
